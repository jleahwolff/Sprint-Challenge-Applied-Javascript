## Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. This helps both you (in case you ever need to return to old code for any number of reasons) and your Team Lead.

## Description

You are going to create a Lambda Newspaper. Your job is going to be to create the components that make up the newspaper's home page. You will do this at first with static data, then you will request data from a server to create dynamic components.

In meeting the minimum viable product (MVP) specifications listed below, you should have a console full of correct responses to the problems given.

## Self-Study Questions

Demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering the following free-form questions.

Edit this document to include your answers after each question. Make sure to leave a blank line above and below your answer so it is clear and easy to read by your project manager

1. What is the DOM?
Document Object Model
2. What is an event?
An event happens to the HTML elements.  So you can manipulate what your page does thorugh JavaScript. 
3. What is an event listener?
A listener listens to an action that occurs, and then does an event based on what you request it to do.  So ex: when the mouse is clicked, the background changes color. 
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
The NodeList is only useful in a browser, and cannot be manipulated in the JavaScript.  When we convert it to an Array, we can work with it in VSCode. 
5. What is a component?
A component is a function that creates HTML elements and applies the data to them. 

### Git Set up

* [x] Fork the project into your GitHub user account
* [x] Clone the forked project into a directory on your machine
* [x] Create a pull request before you start working on the project requirements.  You will continuously push your updates throughout the project.
* [x] You are now ready to build this project with your preferred IDE

## Minimum Viable Product

Your finished project must include all of the following requirements:

* [x] Look through the HTML code and familiarize yourself with the different sections. Some of them already exist, but some need to be filled in. DO NOT add any code to the HTML file itself.

* [x] Following the instructions in the `Header/index.js` file, create the Header component. 

* [x] Following the instructions in the `Tabs/index.js` file, create individual Tabs components.
